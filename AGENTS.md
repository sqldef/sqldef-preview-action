This is a GitHub Action project implemented in TypeScript.

## General Rules

* Write comments to describe what is not obvious in the code. Describing the "why" is a recommended practice.
* Keep README.md up to date.

## Before commit

* Run `npm run all`, `git add dist`, and then commit the changes.

## Code Review

* Ignore `dist/`, which is generated by `npm run all`
